List of the components in epubreader
====================================

1. libepub -- EPUB format support library. It does not depend on QtGui, so
   it can be used in command-line programs.

2. library-model -- helper library that implements QAbstractItemModel of
   e-book library on Maemo 5. Also contains a class that provides thumbnails
   for e-books.

3. epub-extract-metadata -- a command line program that extracts metadata from
   epub files and prints it on standard output. Depends on libepub.

4. extract-epub -- tracker plugin that uses epub-extract-metadata to provide
   metadata for epub files. It does not use Qt directly and is quite small.

5. thumbnailer -- a DBus thumbnailer for Hildon that is able to extract thumbnails
   from EPUB files. Depends on libepub.

6. reader -- main application. Depends on libepub and library-model.
